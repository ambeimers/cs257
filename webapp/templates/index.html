			<h3> Welcome to Music Mania! </h3>
			<h3 style="color:#003F91"> Here is a quick overview of our webapp: </h3>
			<h2><a href="/comparator.html">COMPARATOR</a></h2>
			The compator takes in two artists, years, or songs and displays data based on different attributes.
			For example, if you search "Katy Perry" and "Taylor Swift," you can find out whose music is more popular, energetic, and danceable!
			More information on attributes below.
			<h2><a href="/newmusic.html">FIND NEW MUSIC</a></h2>
			The find new music option allows you to enter up to 3 of your favorite artists, and in
			return we will give you 3 new artists we think you would like.
			<h2><a href="/lookup.html">ARTIST/YEAR LOOKUP</a></h2>
			In the artist/year lookup, you can enter either one artist or one year and get
			information on their most or least song in each attribute category. More information on
			attributes below.
			<h2> ATTRIBUTES </h2>
			<h4>Popularity</h4>
			The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.
			The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.
			<h4>Accousticness</h4>
			A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
			<h4>Danceability</h4>
			Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
			<h4>Duration</h4>
			The duration of the track in milliseconds.
			<h4>Energy</h4>
			Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
			Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
			For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.
			Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
			<h4>Loudness</h4>
			The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
			Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.
			Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).
			Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
			<h4>Speechiness</h4>
			Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
			The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
			 Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words.
			 Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music.
			 Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
			<h4>Tempo</h4>
			The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).
			In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
			<h4>Valence</h4>
			A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
			Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
